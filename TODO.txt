Future features of this project would include:
Breaking down the sound into a series of wavetables

Technically, this could be achieved doing the following:
1. Once we have our SPEAR file read, we can determine it's duration
2. We divide this duration in, say, 10 intervals 
3. We take all the particles in this interval
4. For each partial we consider it's "principal frequency", which was exposed the most, in terms of amplitude and duration
5. We construct the final waveform creating a weighting sum of "principal frequencies" (need to decide of waveform resolution)
